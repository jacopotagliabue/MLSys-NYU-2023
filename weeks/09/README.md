# Week 9

## Structuring ML projects with Metaflow (continued)

We continue from where we left things in [Week 8](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/MLSys-NYU-2023/blob/main/weeks/08/slides.pdf) and start addressing the problem of "trust" in our models: how do we know models are doing the right thing?

## Code

* Login into [Comet](https://www.comet.com/) and get your API KEY - write it down and don't share it: it is required to do your homework!
* `comet_playground.py` contains a simple end-to-end script to test that the Comet integration works as expected - the usual `rye` setup should work. Check the code to know how to run it with the API KEY, e.g. `COMET_API_KEY=xxx MY_PROJECT_NAME=yyy python comet_playground.py`.

## Guest Talk

* [Joao Carreira](https://joao.ai/) from Renaissance Technologies will showcase data analysis tecniques that have been proven useful in his career in finance.
