# Week 4

## Linear Models for Classification

You can run `rye sync` in this directory in order to install all necessary python packages for running both the below notebooks as well as running your homework.

## Notebooks

- [classification.ipynb](./notebooks/classification.ipynb) introduces binary and multiclass classification. The notebooks use two datasets in `data/`.
- [slides.ipynb](./notebooks/slides.ipynb) shows how I developed some plots for this week's slides.
