# Week 4

## Linear Models for Classification

`requirements.txt` holds the Python dependencies for running this weeks' notebooks.

## Notebooks

- [classification.ipynb](./notebooks/classification.ipynb) introduces binary and multiclass classification. The notebooks use two datasets in `data/`.
- [slides.ipynb](./notebooks/slides.ipynb) shows how I developed some plots for this week's slides.
